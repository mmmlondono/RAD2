# The purpose of this script is to optimize the different de novo parameters for Aciurina RAD data 
#Osuna-Mascaro:
#We allowed a maximum missing data of 20 % (--max-missing 0.8), 
#a minimum minor allele frequency of 0.03 (--maf 0.03) and 
#specified a thin value of 5 (--thin 5), which allows that no two sites are within the specified distance from one another. 
#Also, we only included sites with quality scores above 10 (--minQ 10).

##Mean depth
#Generates a file containing the mean depth per site averaged across all individuals.
#the number of reads that have mapped to this position (coverage)
#the more reads that cover a site, the higher confidence our basecall is. 
#Should we set a maximum and a minimum depth?

##Minor alelle frecuencies
#Outputs the allele frequency for each site in a file with the suffix ".frq".
#distribution of allele frequencies. This will help inform our minor-allele frequency (MAF) thresholds
#Usually then, it is best practice to produce one dataset with a good MAF threshold and keep another without any MAF filtering at all.
#Ideally you want an idea of the distribution of your allelic frequencies but 0.05 to 0.10 is a reasonable cut-off.
